  <p> Hello, I'm Stephanie Hernandez, I know my name is a little long so I do let people call me Steph.</p>
  <p> A recent hobby that I've been trying to retouch is my interest in beauty care. </p>
  <p> I was really interested in makeup my junior year when we were all in quarantine due to covid, and I'm trying to get back into it because I think the process of creating a makeup look is soothing. </p>
